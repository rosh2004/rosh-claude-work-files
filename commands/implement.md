Read the spec at docs/specs/$ARGUMENTS.

Implement the next unchecked phase. Follow these rules:
1. Write tests before implementation
2. Run tests after completing each function
3. If tests fail, fix before moving on
4. If something is ambiguous, make a reasonable choice and add a TODO
5. Commit after each phase with a descriptive message
6. Update the spec: check off completed tasks, add notes on decisions
7. Stop after completing one phase. Do not start the next phase.

Do not ask questions. Do not explain your approach. Just implement.
